      software the way that best fits your personal computing habits. Pro
      Antivirus offers simple controls for keeping yourself virus-free. Don't
      Lose Your Game Silent gaming mode means you can play (or surf) without

      (outside your PC), and Web, IM, and P2P shields ensure your safety on
      social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), IM chats (Skype, ICQ, etc.), or
      file-sharing sites. Benefit from real-time protection Hybrid cloud
      technology streams your virus database updates to your PC in real-time, so
      your avast! software has all virus definitions as soon as they are known
      to our Virus Lab. <br /><br /><h4>Know what's coming before you click</h4><br /> Our
      cloud-based FileRep feature keeps reputation data on countless files,
      using select criteria (such as prevalence and emergence) for determining
      risks so we can warn you of a file's reputation beforehand. See your
      avast! history Your AVAST Account portal is your personal directory for
      all your avast! related data. Each month, we also prepare for you a
      Security Report that shows an overview of the most significant details
      (e.g. number of infected sites blocked). <br />Get help from a 'Geek' in
      your network Our new Remote Assistance lets you initiate remote support
      from a family member or friend who agrees to help. Initiated by you, it
      routes through AVAST's servers, bypasses firewalls, and can be terminated
      by you at any time.
